# Welcome

This wiki has been created for you.

You will find inside this pages all the knowledge that has been collectively gathered from the previous experience of the IBP members.

And you will, at some point in your journey, also help correcting, completing and creating tutorials for the benefit of all the Infrastructure Builder's Program.

Everything from choosing your colocation datacenter, to installing hypervisors or deploying vistual machines with specialised node software should have an entry in this wiki!

Enjoy!
