# Introduction

The Infrastructure Builders' Program is a community iniciative to decentralise the services needed by the Dotsama ecosystem.

## Key Links

- Proposal doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16USQYVhlyAlrU829EUB2TRoqUC0nnfoS_uCdZ84HT8k
- Referenda 35: https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/35

## Bounty Management

The program is funded by a bounty, and is managed the curators via a 3/5 multi-sig account.

Each curator (x5) provides an account that is used to create the 3/5 multi-sig.

Payments to members are executed by child-bounties.

## Curators & Advisors
The current curators of the program are:

- anaelleltd | Parity (non-exec)
- bLd | Astar (non-exec)
- CoinStudio (exec)
- Otar | Parity (non-exec)
- will | Parity (non-exec)

The current advisors are:

- Tom | Stake.Plus (exec)
- derek // metaspan (exec)

_non-exec positions are not compensated_
\
_exec positions are compensated for performing additional tasks_

## Monitoring

Each member could run a copy of the monitor. By running a monitor, members publishe their services via gossip to other monitors. Each monitor runs SLA checks on published services, and reports results via gossip. In this way, each instance of the monitor should have all the shared SLA data.

Code for the monitor is open source [here](https://github.com/dotsama-ibp/dotsama-ibp/tree/main/monitor)
