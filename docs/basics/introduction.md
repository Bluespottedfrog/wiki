# Introduction

The Infrastructure Builders' Program is a community iniciative to decentralise the minimum basic services needed by the Dotsama ecosystems and other Subtrate-based projects.

### Originary Documents

- Proposal's [Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16USQYVhlyAlrU829EUB2TRoqUC0nnfoS_uCdZ84HT8k).
- Kusama's [Referenda 35](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/35).

### Bounty Management

The program is initially funded by a bounty in the Kusama network, and it is managed by curators via a 3/5 multi-sig account.

Each curator provides a secured account that is used to create the 3/5 multi-sig.

Payments to members are executed by child-bounties.
